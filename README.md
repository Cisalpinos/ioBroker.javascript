**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

Executes Javascript, Typescript Scripts.

## Forbidden directories for Script Filesystem Mirroring
The Script Filesystem Mirroring will store all Source Files of the Scripts in your Filesystem to allow you to edit the Files in your favourite Script editor beside the Web-Editor. All changes are synced in both directions.

When enabling the Script Filesystem mirroring, please make sure to create a **dedicated new directory** and **do not** use an existing directory with other content. Please also make sure that no other script or process changes files in the provided directory to prevent access issues.
Any location needs to be writable by the "iobroker" user!

Since v5.5.0 of the JavaScript adapter the following locations (relative to the ioBroker Base directory, usually `/opt/iobroker`) are not allowed to be used:
* The ioBroker base directory itself and any path above!
* `./iobroker-data` itself, custom subdirectory (choose a name that do not overlap with any adapter!)
* `./iobroker-data/backup-objects` or the anything below
* `./iobroker-data/files` or the anything below
* `./iobroker-data/backitup` or the anything below
* `./backups` or the anything below
* `./node_modules` or the anything below
* `./log` or the anything below
